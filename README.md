This code is designed for the Xiao ESP32-C3 microcontroller to use with a UDA1334A or MAX98357A DAC (other i2s dac may work as well), to work with Phil Schatzmann's Arduino Audio Tools. https://github.com/pschatzmann/arduino-audio-tools

Lifetime of memory-intensive components are optimised to work with the 400kb restraints of the C3 series microcontroller. When the gnd of the dac is daisy chained to the power supply via the mictocontroller gnd, it is recommended to put a
small series resistor on the bitclock (220 Ohm for instance) to avoid grounding issues, especially when working on a breadboard.
